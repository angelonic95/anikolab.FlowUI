# Dynamics 365 Ribbon & Subgrid Optimizer

This project includes two libraries:
- C# for the Custom API structure
- JavaScript for integration in Ribbon JS files


The key feature of this solution is that the API is called only once for all buttons, improving performance and reducing redundant calls. It also supports Subgrid optimization and potentially Forms.
